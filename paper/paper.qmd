# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We use the statistical programming language R [@citeR].... Our data [@shelter].... Following @tellingstories, we consider...

Overview text

## Measurement
	
Some paragraphs about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an entry in the dataset.

## Outcome variables

Add graphs, tables and text. Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable or update the subheading to be singular.



Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-planes
#| fig-cap: Relationship between wing length and width
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

analysis_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

analysis_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = width, y = length)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Wing width (mm)",
       y = "Wing length (mm)")
```

Talk way more about it. 

## Predictor variables

Add graphs, tables and text.

Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable and feel free to combine a few into one if they go together naturally.

# Discussion

## Correlation vs. Causation {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Missing Data

Please don't use these as sub-heading labels - change them to be what your point actually is.

## Sources of Bias

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.

## Posterior predictive check

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-1 we implement a posterior predictive check. This shows...

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-2 we compare the posterior with the prior. This shows... 

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-cap: "Examining how the model fits, and is affected by, the data"
#| fig-subcap: ["Posterior prediction check", "Comparing the posterior with the prior"]

pp_check(first_model) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

posterior_vs_prior(first_model) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  coord_flip()
```

## Diagnostics

@fig-stanareyouokay-1 is a trace plot. It shows... This suggests...

@fig-stanareyouokay-2 is a Rhat plot. It shows... This suggests...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-stanareyouokay
#| fig-cap: "Checking the convergence of the MCMC algorithm"
#| fig-subcap: ["Trace plot", "Rhat plot"]
#| layout-ncol: 2

plot(first_model, "trace")

plot(first_model, "rhat")
